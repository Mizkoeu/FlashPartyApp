# Flash Party App

I have modified a coding exercise from the past into this small prototype for
the Flash Party App. This web app's backbone controller is in app.js, where the high
level interactions with the web app are specified. The todoContorller.js from controllers
folder is the central controller for CRUD operations on the mongodb database.
The todo-list.js from ./publc/assets/todo-list.js sends Ajax request to the app to
manipulate the database.

This is an exercise I did three months ago teaching myself how to link my AWS EC2 server
with my MongoDB database and create a To-do list web app.

The to-do list App can be accessed at: http://13.58.191.238:4000/todo
Please refrain from adding, deleting information on there.
